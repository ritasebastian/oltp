### **Concurrency, Throughput, and Latency – Simple Explanation**  

These three terms are **important for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** because they impact **how fast and efficiently transactions are handled** in a database system. Let's break them down with simple real-world examples.  

---

### **1️⃣ Concurrency – "Multiple Transactions at the Same Time"**  
- **Definition:** Concurrency means multiple transactions can happen **simultaneously** without interfering with each other.  
- **Example:**  
  - Imagine **100 people booking movie tickets** online at the same time.  
  - The system must handle **all requests** properly without errors (like double booking the same seat).  
- **Importance:**  
  ✅ Prevents deadlocks & ensures smooth multi-user transactions.  
  ✅ Improves **CPU & resource utilization**.

### **2️⃣ Throughput – "Number of Transactions Processed per Second"**  
- **Definition:** Throughput is the **total number of transactions processed per unit of time** (usually per second or minute).  
- **Example:**  
  - A bank server processes **1000 transactions per second (TPS)** during peak hours.  
  - If the throughput is low, some customers may face **delays** in completing their transactions.  
- **Importance:**  
  ✅ Higher throughput = More transactions handled efficiently.  
  ✅ Improves **database performance** under heavy load.

### **3️⃣ Latency – "Delay in Processing a Transaction"**  
- **Definition:** Latency is the **time taken to process a single transaction** from request to response.  
- **Example:**  
  - You swipe your card at an ATM, and it takes **5 seconds** to process the transaction.  
  - If latency is **high**, you will experience **slower responses**.  
- **Importance:**  
  ✅ Low latency = Faster transactions (good for **real-time systems** like ATMs).  
  ✅ Helps in **improving user experience**.

### **Simple Trick to Remember**  
🚀 **Concurrency → Many people doing transactions together.**  
🚀 **Throughput → How many transactions are completed per second.**  
🚀 **Latency → How fast a single transaction gets processed.**  

👉 **Goal of OLTP Systems:**  
✅ **High Concurrency** (Many transactions together)  
✅ **High Throughput** (More transactions per second)  
✅ **Low Latency** (Fast response time)  

This ensures that banking, e-commerce, and other real-time applications run **smoothly and efficiently!** 🚀
